# Getting Started with the Canvas API

This package will get you started with interfacing with the Canvas API using JavaScript/Node.js

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for use with your own API tokens and Canvas domains.

### Prerequisites

1. **Install [Node 8.0.0 or greater](https://nodejs.org)**.
2. **Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**.

### Installation

1. `npm install` installs the necessary dependency ([node-canvas-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-canvas-api)
1. Rename the `sample.env` file to be `.env`, and add your Canvas access token.

### Running the sample code

1. `node index.js` runs the `index.js` file, which logs the user's info from Canvas.

### What to do from here

Write your own code and run it! Be mindful that the API is running on the production Canvas instance - if you want to run against the Beta or Test instance, change the URL in `.env` and generate a new token.
